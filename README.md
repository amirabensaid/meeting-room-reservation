üè¢ Room Reservation Management System
üìñ Project Description

This project is a microservices-based system designed to manage the reservation of meeting rooms within a company.
Users (employees, admins, visitors) can view available rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings easily.
Authentication is handled through OAuth login (e.g., Google Sign-In), ensuring secure and simple access.

The system is built around three key microservices (user-service, salle-service, reservation-service) communicating through Kafka and REST APIs, with PostgreSQL databases for storage.
üöÄ How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/room-reservation-system.git
cd room-reservation-system

Start Kafka and Zookeeper (for message brokering)
You can use Docker:

docker-compose up -d

Run each microservice

    Navigate into each service directory and start it:

        cd user-service
        npm install
        npm run start

        (Repeat for salle-service and reservation-service.)

    Access the application

        APIs are available locally (e.g., http://localhost:5000,5001,5002 etc.).


üõ†Ô∏è Services Overview

    user-service

        Handles user authentication and profile management.

        Manages user roles (Admin / Employee / Visitor).

        OAuth 2.0 login integration (Google).

    salle-service

        Manages meeting room information: creation, update, deletion.

        Publishes room availability updates.

    reservation-service

        Handles creating, cancelling, and listing room reservations.

        Ensures a room is available before confirming a reservation.

        Communicates with user-service and salle-service for validations.
